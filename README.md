# SomeAspNetProject
sample asp.net core project with swagger &amp;&amp; mongo, using common practices. 

Here I've used: 

    - Dependency injection (Constructor injection)
    - MediatR for handling api requests
    - Fluent validation for checking commands 
    - Work with MongoDb (connection string is stored in user-secrets since db is cloud-hosted)
    - Unit tests with Xunit
